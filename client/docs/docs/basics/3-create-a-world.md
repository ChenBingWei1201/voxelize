# Create a World

With a server and two blocks, we are ready to create our first world. 

## Chunks

Before diving into the world creation, we need to talk about what *chunks* are.

The term **chunk** means a column of chunks. By default, it is 16x256x16 blocks. Every world is divided into infinite amount of chunks, and only the chunks around each client is loaded.
