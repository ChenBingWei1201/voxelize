## What is a voxel?

A voxel is a **3D pixel**. It is a **cube** that can be colored, textured, and manipulated. It is the **smallest unit** of a voxel world.

In a voxel world, you can build anything you want. You can build a house, a car, a spaceship, a city, a planet, or even a universe. You can build anything you can imagine.

## What can I do with Voxelize?

Voxelize is a fullstack library. It means that you can use it to build both the **client** and the **server** of your voxel experience. It could be a game, a creative tool, or even a VR experience. Basically, you can build anything you want.
